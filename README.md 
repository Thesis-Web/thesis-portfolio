# James Huson — Portfolio Index

This repo is an **index** for my public-facing work. Most projects are deployed and can be evaluated by reading the repos and visiting the live sites.

## Quick links

- **thesisweb.com (public)** — marketing + signup funnel (Astro + Tailwind)
- **thesisweb-backend (service)** — signup API + email integration + SQLite persistence (Fastify)
- **the-thesis-chain-protocol (specs)** — protocol/spec exploration (consensus + ledger boundaries)
- **the-thesis-project-architecture (docs)** — public-facing architecture framing for a proprietary system
- **the-thesis-chain-ai-devkit (docs/code)** — AI safety/devkit framing (threat models + guardrails)
- **the-thesis-chain-test (sims)** — TypeScript simulations validating system behavior

> Note on IP / confidentiality  
> Some of the underlying systems are proprietary and/or patent-sensitive. The public repos are intentionally “lean”:
> they demonstrate architecture rigor, security posture, engineering discipline, and decision-making without exposing
> sensitive implementation details.

## What each repo demonstrates

### thesis-web-com-site (Astro)
**Signals:** product framing, frontend engineering, accessibility, performance, integration discipline  
- Modern static site pipeline (Astro, Tailwind)
- Terminal typing component with reduced-motion support and “skip” UX
- Clear deploy story (static assets behind nginx)

### thesisweb-backend (Fastify)
**Signals:** pragmatic backend design, security posture, ops-mindedness  
- Localhost-bound API service with rate limiting and hardened request handling
- SQLite persistence (low operational overhead)
- Email integration as a side-effect (non-blocking)

### the-thesis-chain-protocol (specs)
**Signals:** systems thinking, rigorous spec writing  
- Protocol decomposition and boundary design
- Tradeoff documentation and assumptions spelled out

### the-thesis-project-architecture (docs)
**Signals:** architecture leadership under constraint (IP, security, governance)  
- Threat modeling and decision logs
- Clear articulation of goals, non-goals, and operational model

### the-thesis-chain-ai-devkit (docs/code)
**Signals:** AI safety posture, guardrails, platform thinking  
- Threat model oriented design
- “Safe to share” examples and scaffolding

### the-thesis-chain-test (TypeScript sims)
**Signals:** engineering validation, model-driven iteration  
- Simulation harnesses that validate properties of design choices
- Repeatable scripts to reproduce results

## How to evaluate quickly (10–15 minutes)

1. Read **this index** for the repo map.
2. Open **thesisweb-backend** and skim README → security posture and ops choices.
3. Open **the-thesis-chain-protocol** and read the “Start here” section.
4. Open **the-thesis-chain-test** and run one simulation locally (instructions in repo).
