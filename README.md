# James Huson — Engineering Portfolio

This repository is the **entry point** to my public-facing technical work.

It is intentionally structured to demonstrate:
- systems and product architecture
- backend and frontend engineering discipline
- security and operational awareness
- developer productivity and tooling
- the ability to work under IP, confidentiality, and patent constraints

Most projects are live or production-adjacent; others are deliberately “lean” public artifacts that represent much deeper proprietary systems.

## How to review (10–15 minutes)

1. Read this README.
2. Visit **https://thesisweb.com** ## Public-facing website (marketing + signup intake).
3. Review one backend repo and one architecture/spec repo.
4. Skim the tooling repo for workflow maturity.

## Public-facing website (marketing + signup intake)

### ThesisWeb
- **Site:** https://thesisweb.com
- **Frontend repo:** `thesis-web-com-site`
- **Backend repo:** `thesisweb-backend`

This represents:
- UX discipline
- low-overhead deployment (Astro + Fastify + SQLite)
- marketing + positioning
- lead capture (signup) with hardened API integration
- staged rollout / invitation-only posture

## Architecture & systems thinking

### the-thesis-project-architecture
Public-facing architectural framing for a proprietary system:
- decision logs
- threat modeling
- system boundaries
- governance constraints

> Implementation details are intentionally excluded due to IP and patent considerations.

### the-thesis-chain-protocol
Specification-first exploration of protocol and system design:
- consensus separation
- ledger boundaries
- explicit tradeoffs and assumptions

---

## AI & safety-oriented engineering

### the-thesis-chain-ai-devkit
A public, safe-to-share artifact demonstrating:
- threat-model-driven design
- guardrails and boundaries
- platform thinking for AI-assisted systems

---

## Simulation & validation

### the-thesis-chain-test
TypeScript-based simulations used to validate system behavior and design assumptions:
- repeatable runs
- measurable outcomes
- design feedback loops

This repo focuses on *engineering validation*, not presentation polish.

---

## Developer productivity & tooling

### dev-tools
A small collection of internal tools that remove friction from daily engineering work.

Includes:
- `thesis-sync.sh` — a WSL-to-server file routing utility driven by declarative headers

This repo exists to demonstrate:
- automation mindset
- operational safety
- repeatable workflows

---

## Notes on confidentiality & IP

Some of the systems represented here are:
- proprietary
- patent-sensitive
- or subject to confidentiality constraints

Public repos are structured to show **how I think and work**, not to disclose sensitive implementation details.
